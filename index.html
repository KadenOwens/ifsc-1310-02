    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    
    <h3>What is Progressive Enhancement?</h3>
    <p>
      Progressive Enhancement is an approach to web development designed to ensure that every user has a good experience, regardless of the quality of their hardware. 
      The way it works is simple: first, you draft up a thorough and detailed HTML document. 
      The goal is to ensure that the HTML conveys as much information about the content as possible, that way users who either can&apos;t or choose not to utilize CSS and Javascript can still get the most out of your webpage. 
      Next, you decorate your website with CSS, creating a more palatable look which isn&apos;t reliant on the more intensive functionality of Javascript. 
      Finally, you increase the interactivity by implementing Javascript for devices that can handle it. 
      This method ensures that regardless of the quality of the users hardware, they can get the most possible out of your website &mdash; either by viewing the highly detailed HTML, enjoying the well-built CSS, or appreciating the interactivity of your Javascript.
    </p>

    <p>
      Progressive Enhancement was designed as an alternative to Graceful Degradation, another method of trying to ensure all users were able to view content. 
      The largest difference between the two is the approach they take: Graceful Degradation is a process in which you develop a website for higher end hardware, then slowly strip features for devices which are incapable of running them; Progressive Enhancement is a process in which you build the website from the content upwards, ensuring that lower quality devices still have a good experience. 
    </p>

    <h3>Why is Progressive Enhancement Important?</h3>
    <p>
      The biggest reason why it is important can be seen by comparing it to its earlier counterpart. 
      Graceful Degradation works great for higher end devices, but it leaves those without access to them with a much worse experience. 
      After all, the content was designed to be viewed with the CSS and JS, and therefore may not be palatable without them. 
      Progressive Enhancement, on the other hand, designs your website in such a manner that it is still enjoyable without higher level code. 
      Being that the internet is one of the most vital resources in the modern time, and economic inequality is vast amongst the world, it is imperative that developers make their webpages viable for as much hardware as possible &mdash; and while Graceful Degradation technically achieves this, it leaves those with low quality hardware in an even worse position than they already were. 
      Progressive Enhancement ensures that all people have a chance to enjoy the internet, something which is desirable to any developer worth their salt.
    </p>

    <p>
      Besides the ethical reasons, there are also logistical reasons for utilizing Progressive Enhancement. 
      First off, it makes websites accessible to those with disabilities &mdash; for example, having thorough HTML makes screen readers more accessible. 
      Further, as previously mentioned, it makes your website viable for those with worse hardware. 
      Besides this being morally right, it also means your website can receive more traffic, thus increasing its success. 
      For websites which generate money, either directly or indirectly, this is greatly important. 
      It also makes it possible for your website to load with worse internet. 
      Plus, it makes it easier for search engines to spread your content to those who may engage with it, making it even more successful. 
      Thus, there are ethical, financial, and technical benefits to utilizing Progressive Enhancement, making it greatly important.

    <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessiblity</h2>
     <h3>What is Web Accessibility?</h3>
     <p>
       Web accessibility is a fundamental aspect of web design, in which a developer aims to make their application functional for all users, including those who have physical or cognitive impairments that may make typical technological interactions difficult.
       There are a variety of tricks and tools that developers can employ to improve the accessibility of their website. 
       On the HTML level, developers can use clear language and descriptions to help with a user's understanding of the page, section off content properly to help with flow, and use descriptive explanations in the code for screen readers. 
       There are a variety of things developers can do on the CSS level to help improve accessibility, such as using fonts/colors that are visible to those with sight issues, sectioning content to make them more navigable, and ensuring that design choices are accessible to people from different backgrounds. 
       It is also vital that developers consider how various tools such as screen readers, keyboard shortcuts, or colorblind modes will interact with their website. 
       This can include making various sections accessible with the keyboard, putting certain design elements on the HTML level to make sure that they are not removed by the compiler, or including voice commands for those who need them.
     </p>
     <h3>Why is it Important?</h3>
     <p>
      There are a variety of reasons to build an accessible website. 
      From a financial standpoint, it is logical to utilize accesibility features to increase traffic to your website.
      It is also important in regards to the quality of a website: a lack of accesibility features speaks volumes about the effort that went into a website. 
      By far the most important reason, however, is to ensure fairness for all. 
      In an age where the internet is by and large the most important tool in day-to-day life, it would be ignorant and unethical to choose to leave a website inaccessible to those with disabilities. 
      This is especially true as new tools are created for accessibility, making it easier than ever to make a website functional for all. 
      Therefore, it is both logical and morally correct for developers to make their websites accessible.
