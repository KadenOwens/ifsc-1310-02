    <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessiblity</h2>
     <h3>What is Web Accessibility?</h3>
     <p>
       Web accessibility is a fundamental aspect of web design, in which a developer aims to make their application functional for all users, including those who have physical or cognitive impairments that may make typical technological interactions difficult.
       There are a variety of tricks and tools that developers can employ to improve the accessibility of their website. 
       On the HTML level, developers can use clear language and descriptions to help with a user's understanding of the page, section off content properly to help with flow, and use descriptive explanations in the code for screen readers. 
       There are a variety of things developers can do on the CSS level to help improve accessibility, such as using fonts/colors that are visible to those with sight issues, sectioning content to make them more navigable, and ensuring that design choices are accessible to people from different backgrounds. 
       It is also vital that developers consider how various tools such as screen readers, keyboard shortcuts, or colorblind modes will interact with their website. 
       This can include making various sections accessible with the keyboard, putting certain design elements on the HTML level to make sure that they are not removed by the compiler, or including voice commands for those who need them.
     </p>
     <h3>Why is it Important?</h3>
     <p>
      There are a variety of reasons to build an accessible website. 
      From a financial standpoint, it is logical to utilize accesibility features to increase traffic to your website.
      It is also important in regards to the quality of a website: a lack of accesibility features speaks volumes about the effort that went into a website. 
      By far the most important reason, however, is to ensure fairness for all. 
      In an age where the internet is by and large the most important tool in day-to-day life, it would be ignorant and unethical to choose to leave a website inaccessible to those with disabilities. 
      This is especially true as new tools are created for accessibility, making it easier than ever to make a website functional for all. 
      Therefore, it is both logical and morally correct for developers to make their websites accessible.
