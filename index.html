    <h2>Dragon Revision and Reflection</h2>

    <h3>What were the things you did well? </h3>
    <p>
      Throughout the semester, there are several things that I think I did well. One of these was either attending or watching every lecture in its entirety, something that is a bit of a struggle for me due to my ADHD. I also felt comfortable with everything we learned, which was quite pleasing. I also thought I did pretty well with all of my assignments. I gave a good effort to each one, and I can clearly tell that I got substantially better with each consecutive one.
    </p>

    <p>
      In terms of the final project, I was very pleased with both how it turned out and the work that it took to get there. I was proud of my design, which took elements from the actual SpaceX dragon and coupled it with my own ideas. My HTML document only needed a few changes while I wrote the CSS, most of which were just from simple mistakes while marking up the original document. Some of the CSS posed a struggle, but I felt I did quite well with using flex boxes to get my content where I wanted. I had paper plannings for how I wanted the website to look, and I managed to pull off just about everything I had hoped to. Overall, I think I did quite well with both the class and the final project.
    </p>

    <h3>What would you do differently if you had to start over?</h3>
    <p>
      If I were to start over, the first thing I would do is try and get more notes on paper. I took a fair amount over the readings, but I didn&apos;t get as much about the specific code elements from the HTML or CSS. While this isn&apos;t a big deal, since they can be looked up fairly easily, it would&apos;ve been nice to have a written version as well. I would also start my own project to work on as we did our work together, as I think that would&apos;ve made it easier to draft a website from scratch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Speaking of, the biggest thing I would do if I could start my project over is take time between getting an idea for the website design and drafting the HTML document to figure out what kind of CSS it will take to pull off my visual ideas. The biggest changes to my HTML came from having to rewire it into different groupings for sectioning content. Furthermore, my biggest headaches in the CSS came from being unable to manipulate objects like I wanted due to their HTML structure. That&apos;s just one of those things that I wish I would&apos;ve thought of before I started drafting; I tried to draft it into groups and sections that I knew had commonalities, but I didn&apos;t do it as well as I should&apos;ve upfront. Also, I would try and figure out how large I wanted elements to be early on, so that I didn&apos;t have to constantly tweak them as I kept going. Finally, I would make sure to keep everything consistent throughout, namely elements of the Header that I thought were going to change from page to page, but which ultimately looked much better when standardized.
    </p>

    <h3>What feedback did you recieve?</h3>
    <p>
      I got a lot of feedback from a few friends of mine, which I compiled into a huge list and broke up into chunks. By the time I was done, I had seven main goals: update the header, make the text/image combos look better, standardize the top of the webpage, update all elements for consistency and appeal, rework the design for the FAQs, implement Javascript, and add in media queries for screen sizes. I approached them one at a time. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For the header, I cropped the SpaceX logo, made it a link to their website, and made it a list item so I could make the spacing more even for a cleaner look. For the image/text combos, I created new divs which allowed me to turn the content into flex boxes that I could manipulate easier. For the top of the webpage, and the rest, I decided to increase the size of each section to a full screen size, so the content on it could be the sole focus at any given time. I did this for each page, and made sure the title of the page was front and center for the viewer. I did some various updates for the design elements to make it look better, from font choices to the location of elements. I took the FAQ and completely reworked it into dropdown menus with bottom borders, better text structuring, and a centralized design. I used Java to make the title disappear as you scrolled down, a feature I really liked from the SpaceX website. Finally, I added in the media queries I had meant to do before but completely forgot about.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were some things which I chose not to do. For example, I decided that rather than change the gradient into a darker one, I would simply utilize the page one gradient on every page. I found that these pages became much more sizable once I altered the height for each section, and I liked the way the gradient fell. I also left the abstract structure of the page, as I believed that the content flowed well enough with the other changes I made that I could leave the unique shaping. I also decided not to make it more compact, allowing the vast and open sections to speak for themselves &mdash; this is a website for a space exploration company, after all.

    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    
    <h3>What is Progressive Enhancement?</h3>
    <p>
      Progressive Enhancement is an approach to web development designed to ensure that every user has a good experience, regardless of the quality of their hardware. 
      The way it works is simple: first, you draft up a thorough and detailed HTML document. 
      The goal is to ensure that the HTML conveys as much information about the content as possible, that way users who either can&apos;t or choose not to utilize CSS and Javascript can still get the most out of your webpage. 
      Next, you decorate your website with CSS, creating a more palatable look which isn&apos;t reliant on the more intensive functionality of Javascript. 
      Finally, you increase the interactivity by implementing Javascript for devices that can handle it. 
      This method ensures that regardless of the quality of the users hardware, they can get the most possible out of your website &mdash; either by viewing the highly detailed HTML, enjoying the well-built CSS, or appreciating the interactivity of your Javascript.
    </p>

    <p>
      Progressive Enhancement was designed as an alternative to Graceful Degradation, another method of trying to ensure all users were able to view content. 
      The largest difference between the two is the approach they take: Graceful Degradation is a process in which you develop a website for higher end hardware, then slowly strip features for devices which are incapable of running them; Progressive Enhancement is a process in which you build the website from the content upwards, ensuring that lower quality devices still have a good experience. 
    </p>

    <h3>Why is Progressive Enhancement Important?</h3>
    <p>
      The biggest reason why it is important can be seen by comparing it to its earlier counterpart. 
      Graceful Degradation works great for higher end devices, but it leaves those without access to them with a much worse experience. 
      After all, the content was designed to be viewed with the CSS and JS, and therefore may not be palatable without them. 
      Progressive Enhancement, on the other hand, designs your website in such a manner that it is still enjoyable without higher level code. 
      Being that the internet is one of the most vital resources in the modern time, and economic inequality is vast amongst the world, it is imperative that developers make their webpages viable for as much hardware as possible &mdash; and while Graceful Degradation technically achieves this, it leaves those with low quality hardware in an even worse position than they already were. 
      Progressive Enhancement ensures that all people have a chance to enjoy the internet, something which is desirable to any developer worth their salt.
    </p>

    <p>
      Besides the ethical reasons, there are also logistical reasons for utilizing Progressive Enhancement. 
      First off, it makes websites accessible to those with disabilities &mdash; for example, having thorough HTML makes screen readers more accessible. 
      Further, as previously mentioned, it makes your website viable for those with worse hardware. 
      Besides this being morally right, it also means your website can receive more traffic, thus increasing its success. 
      For websites which generate money, either directly or indirectly, this is greatly important. 
      It also makes it possible for your website to load with worse internet. 
      Plus, it makes it easier for search engines to spread your content to those who may engage with it, making it even more successful. 
      Thus, there are ethical, financial, and technical benefits to utilizing Progressive Enhancement, making it greatly important.

  <section id="accessbility">
    <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessiblity</h2>
     <h3>What is Web Accessibility?</h3>
     <p>
       Web accessibility is a fundamental aspect of web design, in which a developer aims to make their application functional for all users, including those who have physical or cognitive impairments that may make typical technological interactions difficult.
       There are a variety of tricks and tools that developers can employ to improve the accessibility of their website. 
       On the HTML level, developers can use clear language and descriptions to help with a user's understanding of the page, section off content properly to help with flow, and use descriptive explanations in the code for screen readers. 
       There are a variety of things developers can do on the CSS level to help improve accessibility, such as using fonts/colors that are visible to those with sight issues, sectioning content to make them more navigable, and ensuring that design choices are accessible to people from different backgrounds. 
       It is also vital that developers consider how various tools such as screen readers, keyboard shortcuts, or colorblind modes will interact with their website. 
       This can include making various sections accessible with the keyboard, putting certain design elements on the HTML level to make sure that they are not removed by the compiler, or including voice commands for those who need them.
     </p>
     <h3>Why is it Important?</h3>
     <p>
      There are a variety of reasons to build an accessible website. 
      From a financial standpoint, it is logical to utilize accesibility features to increase traffic to your website.
      It is also important in regards to the quality of a website: a lack of accesibility features speaks volumes about the effort that went into a website. 
      By far the most important reason, however, is to ensure fairness for all. 
      In an age where the internet is by and large the most important tool in day-to-day life, it would be ignorant and unethical to choose to leave a website inaccessible to those with disabilities. 
      This is especially true as new tools are created for accessibility, making it easier than ever to make a website functional for all. 
      Therefore, it is both logical and morally correct for developers to make their websites accessible.
