                This isn't all we make, however. 
                Being a custom cabinet shop gives us the ability to create just about anything, so if you have a specific cabinet need, let us know!
            </p>

            <h4>Doors</h4>

            <p>
                Although cabinets may be our main focus, the first thing someone often sees when looking at a cabinet is its door. 
                Because of this, it is vital that a cabinet has an excellent set of doors, which both function properly and set the tone for the room.
                <em>For that reason, we create our own custom doors in house, so that we can ensure your woodworking needs are met.</em>
                <!--This shows that the line of texts encased within should have a greater emphasis than the surrounding text, though not as much as text with the strong tag.-->
            </p>

            <h5>Note: There are some doors we are currently incapable of creating in house. We have vendors for these specific constructions.</h5>

            <h4>Molding</h4>

            <p>
                We also install crown molding, saving you the need to reach out to a different contractor.
                This also ensures that your molding matches your cabinets, saving you from any potential headaches.
            </p>

            <h4>Hardware</h4>

            <p>
                As mentioned earlier, we utilize thousands of different pieces of hardware, allowing for unparalleled customization.
